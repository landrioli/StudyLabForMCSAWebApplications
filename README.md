# StudyLabForMCSAWebApplications
This repository is my personal code lab to study for MCSA Web Application Certification

My study will happen based on the following books:

*The C# Programmerâ€™s Study Guide (MCSD) Exam: 70-483
Ali Asad
Hamza Ali

*Exam Ref 70-483: Programming in C#
Wouter de Kort

I'm also using the videos from PluralSight (C# Path) as a complementary material.
